Ipyinter
=======

Ipyinter is a tool for MATLAB to operate IronPython objects, which is originally used by Dr. Yi-nan Zhao's [(orcid)](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7335-8164) research team. This team is dedicated to developing advanced radar signal processing techniques including adaptive detector and adaptive waveform design methods. The main author of Ipyinter is Dr. Feng-cong Li [(orcid)](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3337-2578). <br/>
Both of Matlab and Python are the workhorse of our team; hence, the productivity will increase if we can combine these two excellent programming platform. Since Matlab now supports .NET platform, it will be much easier to embed IronPython than CPython. Therefore, we developed this toolkit. Its source code was originally posted on Feng-cong Li's blog ['xialulee's blog'](http://blog.sina.com.cn/xialulee).<br/>
